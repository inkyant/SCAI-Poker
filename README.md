# SCAI-Poker

Project for hackathon "SCAI is no limit" 2023 by the Santa Cruz AI (SCAI).

Predicts chances of winning a poker game. The dataset is: https://yungwang.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pluribus_converted_logs.zip
download and extract that into a folder pluribus_converted_logs. Run process_data.py to turn the data into a csv, or use the existing csv.

NN model (main.py) included. 
If you run those files you will also be prompted to submit a set of cards at the end, the AI will analyize those cards.
